There used to be an RSS feed for new uploads on [the Reaktor User Library](http://www.native-instruments.com/en/community/reaktor-user-library) - now there is again.

Feed available [here](http://radian.sdfeu.org/reaktor_library_rss.php)

TODO: I also used to tweet the [here](https://twitter.com/reaktor_lib) but I've lost the keys / forgotten the password.
